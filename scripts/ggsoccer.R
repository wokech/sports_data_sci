# Because ggsoccer is implemented as ggplot layers, it makes 
# customising a plot very easy. Here is a different example, 
# plotting shots on a green pitch.

# Note that by default, ggsoccer will display the whole pitch. 
# To display a subsection of the pitch, simply set the plot limits 
# as you would with any other ggplot2 plot. Here, we use the xlim 
# and ylim arguments to coord_flip.

# Because of the way coordinates get flipped, we must also reverse 
# the y-axis to ensure that the orientation remains correct.

# Data Providers

# ggsoccer defaults to Optaâ€™s 100x100 coordinate system. However, different 
# data providers may use alternative coordinates.

# ggsoccer provides support for a few data providers out of the box, as well 
# as an interface for any custom coordinate system:
  
  # Opta
  # Statsbomb
  # Wyscout

# Statsbomb

# ggsoccer enables you to rescale coordinates from one data provider to another, too
